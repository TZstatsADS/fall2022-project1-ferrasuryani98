### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: What's in a realist's mind? uncovering Aristotle and Locke's way of thinking
+ This project is conducted by Ferra Suryani

+ Project summary: Aristotle and John Locke are both key realism philosophers, one of the four main school of philosophy that focuses on the foundation of scientific reasoning and teaches how draw our observations and conclusions from the world around us, rather than confining ourselves to an analysis of our own ideas. In this project, I'd want to dive deep into these realists by analyzing the text contained in each respective works, which was done using the following approaches: finding common words and most important words used in each works, finding relationship among important words, word usage comparison, and topic modeling.
